Introduction

Pollution is one of the serious matters and one of the enemies of nature and human. Although it is a really serious matter yet unsolved. Mixing of pollutants in pure things that makes things harmful or useless called pollution. Pollution is like a curse for humanity, nature and other living beings on earth. It has affected space too.

Type of Pollution

There are so many kinds of pollution. Below are few of them:

Water Pollution
Air Pollution
Soil Pollution
Noise Pollution

There are more but we would talk about four topics given above.

Impact on Living Being

Due to pollution, human health has a bad effect. Drinking polluted water leads to deadly diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea. Air pollution can lead to asthma, respiratory problems, cancerous diseases. Due to soil pollution, the yield of crops is affected, fruits and vegetables can be toxic, which is fatal_to humans and cattle. Sound pollution can lead to irritability, panic and deafness in humans. In fact, every type of pollution affects us in some form.

Impact on Non-living Being

Pollution also affects the survivors. For example, air pollution increases the temperature of the atmosphere, this increases heat, heat causes draught, draught affects the crop, this affects the normal life of the people. Not only that, due to heat rise, ice is melting on the poles of the earth, due to melting of the ice, the water level of the sea is rising, raised water level threatens to sink coastal areas. Scientists believe that in the coming years, the coastal cities will be submerged. As a result, migrating, unemployment, arson and violence will rise. Looks slight in the hearing but just think about it.

Remedies

Development in society is essential for a human being but development has side effect named Pollution. Although we need development it is for users that we should make proper arrangements for the wastage. We should not leave them open in nature.

it into the water.

(3) Polythene, pesticide, solid waste must not be poured into water.
